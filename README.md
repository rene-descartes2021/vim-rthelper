# RT Helper

RTHelper is a plugin that takes care of generating a json schema used for
validation in yaml-language-server.

RTHelper uses a ctags tag file generated by Gutentags to generate the json
schema. This ctags tag file can also be used to navigate the yaml.

`Ctrl+]` Jump to tag
`Ctrl+n` Jump to next tag of same name (used in case of ambiguity)
`Ctrl+p` Jump to previous tag of same name
`Ctrl+t` Jump back up stack

The use of tag jumping predates the use of language servers and does not
use context to resolve ambiguity: jumping to the next and previous tag works
around that.


## How?

Integrates with [vim-gutentags](https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags),
[yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server),
and if available: [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp),
[vim-lsp-settings](https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings), and
[dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim).

Install RTHelper like any other Vim plugin.

You can access Gutentags help pages with `help gutentags`, and RTHelper's help
pages with `help rthelper`.


## What?

Gutentags will (re)generate tag files as you work while staying
completely out of your way. It will even do its best to keep those tag files
out of your way too. It has no dependencies and just works.

RTHelper will then (re)generate the json schema and notify yaml-language-server
of the change using vim-lsp if available.

In order to generate tag files, Gutentags will have to figure out what's in
your project. To do this, it will locate well-known project root markers like
SCM folders (`.git`, `.hg`, etc.), any custom tags you define (with
`gutentags_project_root`), and even things you may have defined already with
other plugins, like [CtrlP][].

If the current file you're editing is found to be in such a project, Gutentags
will make sure the tag file for that project is up to date. Then, as you work
in files in that project, it will partially re-generate the tag file. Every
time you save, it will silently, in the background, update the tags for that
file.

Usually, ctags can only append tags to an existing tag file, so Gutentags
removes the tags for the current file first, to make sure the tag file is
always consistent with the source code.

Also, Gutentags is clever enough to not stumble upon itself by triggering
multiple ctags processes if you save files too fast, or your project is really
big.


## Why?

Navigating and making sense of RobustToolbox yaml files was difficult for me
and I thought to make a tool to do so as an exercise.
